Description:
You have gotten a prestigious job as photographer for a bubble conference. Your job is to take pictures of the 1v1 bubble wars, where two people will blow bubbles at each other one at a time to see who wins. You aren’t sure how they determine a winner, but that’s fine since you just have to photograph.

You want to make sure that all the bubbles in your photos have equal representation, i.e, none of the bubbles are obscured by other bubbles. You’ve decided to write a program to sift through your photos and determine if they are good photos, with the following algorithm in mind:
Each picture has two x,y coordinates associated with the respective bubbles as they appear in the picture
Each picture also gives the radii of the two bubbles as they appear in the picture
Return “Good Picture” if the bubbles don’t overlap
Return “Unfair Picture” if the bubbles do overlap

Input:
The input will consist of two lines, each with an x, y, and r corresponding to the x and y coordinates of the bubbles and their radii.  0<=x,y<=100 and 1<=r<=50

Output:
Print the string “Good Picture” if the bubbles do not overlap. Print “Unfair Picture” otherwise.

Examples:
In(1):
0 0 10
100 100 10

Out(1):
Good Picture

In(1)
0 2 2
0 3 2

Out(1):
Unfair Picture
