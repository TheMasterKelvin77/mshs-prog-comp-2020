Description:
You are working on your math homework, and realize you don’t remember how to multiply numbers together! Ordinarily, you’d email your professor for help, but she’s getting a bit tired of you after your addition fiasco last week. You decide you have to take this into your own hands, but learning multiplication all over again is a lot of work! The best solution is to create a computer program that will multiply numbers for you, so you can focus on really nailing down those addition skills.

Input:
Input will be in the form "N * M", where N and M are the two integers to be multiplied. 0 < N, M < 100,000

Output:
A single integer that is the solution to the multiplication problem.

Examples:
In(1):
2 * 3

Out(1):
6

In(2):
13 * 13

Out(2):
169
